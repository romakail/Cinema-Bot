# [Cinema-Bot](http://t.me/CinemaSearch_SDAKail_bot)
This telegram bot searches the internet to find links for watching movies online.
In this project I have used [googlesearch API](https://github.com/MarioVilas/googlesearch) to search for links and [TMDB database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to get all the supplementary information about the movie.
This bot supports commands:
* /start
* /help

To launch the bot simply run
```bash
BOT_TOKEN=<bot_token> python3 cinema_bot.py
```
